Pusceiver-iOS
=============

The Pusceiver client for iOS.


## How to build

    pod install
    open pusceiver-ios.xcworkspace


## Notes about missing Pods directory

This project depends on some third-party, not open-sourced, pods of CocoaPods, 
but adding those files into the repository bloats the repository
and may violate license agreements.
So Pods directory isn't in the repository.
